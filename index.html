<h2>Summary</h2><br/>
<br/>
It's time to take back our government!  Peacefully, of course.  We're all sick of the politicians screwing up our government and wasting our taxes.  Vote out the dirty rats and bring in some regular Joes that have a vested interest in a well-running government.  If you think your vote doesn't matter, then stick it to the man by writing in your vote for me.  Don't throw your vote away, make a statement with it!<br/><br/>
We have extreme problems heading our way which require extreme solutions.  When neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can muster up a convincing candidate we're left with picking someone out of a hat.  I'm volunteering to take on this thankless job because I have a number of outside-the-box ideas that might help us all out and I'm willing to step on a few toes to make it happen.  <br/><br/>
My platform involves major tax reform and rebalancing the government in numerous ways, almost all of which require congressional support:

<h2>Why you should vote for John E Medema III</h2><br/>
<br/>
So what makes me better than the other guys?<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, I'm not a politician.  I don't plan on going to fundraisers or campaign rallies.  The internet is my podium; my voice.  I do not plan on making commercials, radio ads, or other forms of intrusive and annoying media blitzes.  This is a grassroots campaign pushed by the people.  There won't even be official Twatter and FecesBook accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Because I am not a politician, I am not under the thumb of any industry or political group.  I don't play the political favors game.  I call them like I see them.  Beware: not being a politician means I have no need to be politically correct.  Occasionally I'm going to step on a few toes and get people upset about molehills/mountains.  Offended people will need to grow a little backbone.<br/>
<br/>
Second, in my day job I work with computers, networks and security.  I know how to fix complex problems that require attention to detail and an attention span longer than the average commercial.  I'm a glorified plumber (no offense to plumbers intended).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think outside the box.  I don't go for obvious solutions because other people have already suggested them and have been found insufficient (the solutions, not the people).  I'm not saying that I would have thought to cut the Gordian Knot, but I would have tried to convince whoever was tied up by it to go on a diet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>How (and why) to vote</h2><br/>
<br/>
As an independent candidate who is entering this race at such a late date, there is no way to officially get on the ballot.  My name will never be typed in next to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Gary Johnson, or Jill Stein.  Fortunately, you are fully able to write in your own candidate.  You can vote for people who aren't actually running (Bruce Willis), dead guys (Jesse Ventura), or even made up guys (Bart Simpson).  In this case, you should write in your vote as <strong>JOHN E. MEDEMA III</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>VOTERS</strong>: There has never been a better time to vote 3rd party or independent.  It's a race to the bottom between Hillary and Donnie.  Most voters disapprove of both of them; they're in the Anyone-But-Hillary or Anyone-But-Trump crowds.  ABH and ABT people: put your money where your mouth is and take a serious look at the 3rd parties.  I know you think you'd be throwing away your vote; you're simply wrong.  With this high of candidate dissatisfaction, it's time for the people to have some public discussions about alternative parties.  Irrespective of how viable any candidate might be, discuss how well their platforms compare to your beliefs.  Start talking to other people about how well Johnson's policies on marijuana mesh with yours, or how Stein's policies on the environment fit your beliefs of how the government should work.  You will be surprised how well one of them fits your beliefs.  Once people start comparing notes we'll all see just how viable the Libertarians and Greens *really* are.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>MEDIA</strong>: Start doing your job.  We have a majority of voters who are dissatisfied with the current political makeup and party candidates for the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch.  In short, as a nation we're at the cusp of a 6th party evolution (anyone remember the whigs?).  It's your duty to start providing alternatives to the status quo because it won't be status quo for long.  Trump is entertaining, but there's more to this story.  I realize that most media venues wish to stay neutral (and rightly so) but the media can still stay neutral while providing short summaries of the highlights of the alternative parties.  As an American citizen it's frankly embarrassing to say this but I didn't even know about 3rd parties until midway through college (20 years old, after I was allowed to vote).  The school system continues to fail us here, but the media is equally at fault.  The next generation of voters need to know ASAP that there are alternatives to the dusty old parties that got us into this mess.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Tax Reform</h2><br/>
<br/>
Taxes suck.  In the US, they are complex to the point that only major companies can afford to appropriately minimize their tax burden.  I aim to replace our existing income tax structure with a simplified system that is fair for all people, does not burden the poorest of us, and forces the corporations to pay along with us.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Executive Summary:</strong><br/>
My tax plan is to increase the standard deduction for all individuals to $35,000 (married filing jointly will be $70,000) and replace <em>all</em> tax brackets with a single universal tax bracket of 30%.  <em>This framework will eliminate all tax loopholes for the rich, allow 50% of the population to pay no tax whatsoever, and maintain current revenue levels for the government</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Corporations will also be granted a $35,000 deduction and be taxed at 30% universally.  <em>This framework will allow 70% of corporations to pay no tax while increasing corporate income revenue for the government by 76%!</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fine print and clarifications:<br/>
<br/>
1) To be clear, my reformed income system only addresses <em>income</em> taxes.  There is no change to payroll taxes (social security, medicare, etc) or sales/consumption taxes (which in fact don't exist at the federal level).  I'm not touching payroll taxes because we're going to need to fund Medicare & Social Security to handle our commitments the baby boomer generation (I'd love to kill it off after that though, but as long as I'm wishing I'd like a pony too).<br/>
<br/>
2) I would get rid of the individual & corporate Alternative Minimum Taxes.  I'd also get rid of exemptions (it's all rolled into the standard deduction).  In fact, I'd get rid of the itemized deductions as well.  Business expense deductions would not happen under individual tax returns; file an 1120 instead.  The point of all this is to simplify the tax process and get rid of loopholes after all.  Deductions, credits, and schedules all go the way of the dodo.  About the only deduction I'd keep is charitable donations (to registered charities who have to report that income).<br/>
<br/>
3) I'll get rid of most of the filing status options as well.  I'd keep "Single" (renamed "Individual") and "Married filing jointly" (which would be applicable for any two beings legally married).  There would be no financial benefit to filing jointly, but it would reduce paperwork for all involved so it can stay.<br/>
<br/>
4) I'd definitely try to keep the deduction amount scaled to cost of living, and I'd definitely try to keep the tax rate stable at this rate (assuming we as a people don't need to increase it globally to attack the federal deficit or Medicare).  As an initial plan, I'd suggest annually adjusting the standard deduction to the last year's median income.<br/>
<br/>
5) Sounds too good to be true?  There are, of course, some downsides.  The tax dollars that used to be owed by the poor has been shifted upward and spread evenly throughout to everyone else.  So the middle and upper classes will see an increase in taxes to recoup the reduction in taxes for the poor.  The $75,000-500,000 income range feels the pain here, with a 20-30% increase in taxes (which can also be seen as a 3-5% drop in income).  I'm within this range myself, and I'd take on that additional burden in order to see someone making $25,000/yr trying to come up with $1,500 for Uncle Sam.  Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot that can be done about the problem without reverting back to our existing tax setup (multiple brackets with lots of fine print).  Increasing the standard deduction requires an even larger increase in the tax rate to make up for the fact that even fewer people are paying taxes.  For example, we could increase the standard deduction to $57,000 but the tax rate would need to be 43%.  The only real benefit to this alternative is that 43 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Additionally, I'd like to keep the tax burden on at least 50% of the population so that we can say that the US isn't literally funded by corporations and the elite.  <br/>
<br/>
6) My original intention for picking $35,000 for the standard deduction was to make the cost of living exempt from taxes.  Of course, different areas of the country have different costs of living, but that cannot be accounted for unless we <em>increase</em> the complexity of the tax system, essentially forcing individuals to file corporate returns.  The current corporate tax system is voodoo magic.  After calculating receipts (aka income), companies are allowed to deduct employee wages, cost of goods, rent, depreciation, and even advertising!  Basically, the cost of business is non-taxable.  After deducting all that we're left with Net Income, which then gets turned into something labeled "Income subject to tax", which is often only 20% of Net Income!  After all this voodoo in the current system, the effective tax rates for corporations are often in the single-digit ranges.  I dropped this approach (mirroring individual returns after form 1120) because the increase of complexity would require an accountant which wouldn't work for the lower classes.<br/>
<br/>
7) My tax plan and Trump's are surprisingly similar; they share the same basic ideas.  The main difference between my plan and his is that mine keeps federal revenue intact while Trump's gives everyone a tax break and bankrupts the government so it won't work.  Clinton's tax plan is basically keeping the tax structure as-is, other than "closing loopholes".  Her plan will make the middle class AND the rich pay more, and it does nothing to alleviate the burden of the poor.<br/>
<br/>
8) My plan does not repeal the Obamacare tax penalty, unfortunately.  It will be dropped as soon as Obamacare is repealed of course, but I can't justify dropping it while we still need to pay for the national healthcare/moneysink market.<br/>
<br/>
9) My corporate tax plan comes with a BIG OLD ASTERISK: The federal tax statistics which I used for my research are much more dirty than the individual tax statistics.  In fact, I'd go so far to say that the corporate tax system is voodoo magic and I can't say with my normal confidence that I know what's going on in there.  After all the loophole voodoo in the current system, effective tax rates for corporations are often in the single-digit ranges.  This is the reason why our corporate tax structure is completely broken, and why the tax increases you will see below in the tables are so high; unless my big old asterisk applies and I have no idea what I'm talking about.  If any tax experts are reading this, drop me a line and upgrade my brain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

For the math nerds, below are the summaries of the changes that would apply to different income brackets and filing statuses.  In the references section (at the bottom of the page) are links to even more details and math magic.  Enjoy the feast!<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Congressional Rebalancing</h2><br/>
<br/>
With only 10% approval, the US Congress can be effectively considered dysfunctional.  There are numerous reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Problem #1: Congressional Gridlock</strong><br/>
Some are upset with the natural gridlock that occurs with the House controlled by one party and the Senate is controlled by the other party.  Sadly, there is nothing to be done about this until election day.  We just need to vote better in November.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Problem #2: Trustworthiness (Disenfranchisement)</strong><br/>
There is growing belief that our Congressmen and even our President are no longer representing the people.  The congressmen/women are bought by commercial interests, or at best they are voting against their constituents' wishes on some issues as part of some back-door deal ("I'll vote for your craptastic agenda if you vote for mine").<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Problem #3: Subject-Matter Expertise</strong><br/>
Even in the best of cases, when each congressional member is voting in the best interest of their constituents, too often they have no idea what the actual issues are or what proposals for remedy are truly effective.  A truly sad/hilarious example of this type of situation is the 1897 Indiana state legislature's accidental attempt to define the mathematical constant pi as 3.2 (<a target="_blank" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill</a>).  A current example of this is the ongoing debate over individual privacy and device encryption.  Government officials, in the name of national security (aka governmental overreach), want to force all device manufacturers to provide backdoors into their systems for terror prevention purposes.  However, many of those proponents refuse to admit is that those same backdoors can be used by evildoers the world over.  There's no way to protect the backdoors, technologically or legislatively.  Anyone who tells you otherwise does not know how encryption works, nor how the black market works.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about other industries, but our congressmen/women don't know jack about technology.  From what I know of congressional procedure, the House and/or Senate will bring in subject matter experts to tell them what the problem is and what they need to do to fix it.  But here we have the same problem - how does congress go about finding the subject matter experts when they don't have the first clue about the problem?  All too often they end up bringing in their corporate cronies who lobby for whatever suits the suits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Solution: Increase the number of Representatives and Senators</strong><br/>
As you can see below, the number of constituents per Congressperson has been growing steadily throughout the history of the United States.  Over time, this has led to each congressperson to become more and more powerful and less in touch with their constituents.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>House of Representatives</strong><br/>
The founding fathers had originally intended the House of Representatives to have a 1 Rep. / 50,000 voters ratio (this was originally supposed to be an 1st Amendment to the Constitution, but it didn't make it due to political machinations).  However they did not require this ratio and over time the ratio steadily grew.  By 1929 various issues caused Congress to modify the House's process to determine the number of seats from a population-based formula to a static, unchanging number (435 seats, unless a territory is promoted to a state).  I propose to bring us back to a population-based method of generating seats.  I'd let an expert committee (via Congress) decide the exact details of how to do it, but my initial suggestion is to go back to the Jefferson method (the first one we used way back in 1793) with a ratio of 1/50,000 instead of 1/33,000.<br/>
<br/>
The effects of this will be numerous and subtle, of course.  But the primary effects are easy to pick out; we would jump to 6,174 Representatives, apportioned to the states proportionally.  This number will increase with each census, virtually always increasing (but perhaps decreasing when the baby boomers die off).  The increase in Representatives will of course cost us more money overall, but surprisingly the cost will be worth it.  As it stands right now, it isn't difficult for Big Data, Big Tobacco, Big Healthcare, etc, to influence 435 Representatives.  Influencing over 6000 Representatives will be more difficult.  Similarly, getting 6000 Representatives to agree to a pork-barrel-laden bill will be more difficult to achieve.  This should provide additional pressure to reduce the fat.  Other important benefits are also apparent with a moment's thought.  With a 1/50,000 ratio, each Representative will have a smaller constituency to manage and be responsible for.  This will give them the ability to talk directly with their voters again and become a representative in truth.  This will go a long way towards repairing the lost trust in our Representatives (see problem #2 above).<br/>
<br/>
Other benefits to the increase in Representatives include the ability to have subject-matter experts directly within Congress (finally).  Imagine a country where the Representatives have one of their own who knows about insurance, IT, airline management, or trucking.  Someone who can explain it to other politicians in a way that doesn't involve money changing hands.  Someone who can explain why a watered-down bill is ineffective as a solution for the particular industry under the microscope.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue would be the simple fact that you can't fit 6,000 people in a building and hope to achieve anything other than setting a record for the longest bathroom lines.  That problem is simple to overcome however, now that we have plenty of remote presence technologies at our fingertips.  Congressmen might complain about the security of said technologies; my suggestion is that they vote to make NSA backdoors illegal :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Senate</strong><br/>
So what about the Senate?  Can we apply the same fix?  Unfortunately not.  Unlike the House, the Senate was designed at birth to be a means of representation for <important>states</important>, not the people.  We're talking about the 1790's here, where 13 colonies had 13 different sets of rules and even 13 sets of currency.  In fact, originally the Senators weren't even decided by popular vote - they were voted in by each State's Legislatures!  The senate was envisioned to be an elite group of representation, filled with people smarter and more educated than the Representatives.  Fortunately, over time these roles have receded into the background, in favor of their current primary purpose - the Senate, with equal membership by state, is a protector of the minority.  Without the Senate's equal structure, a coalition of GA, MI, OH, IL, PA, FL, NY, TX, and CA could pass a simple-majority bill (assuming the coalition exists in both houses).  So we don't want to move to a population-based system.  However, we can still increase the number of senators overall (still providing equal senators per state) to gain the benefits as stated above (making it harder for companies to bribe congressmen, making it easier to get experts into the Senate, etc).  I'd start with 10 senators per state, for a total of 500 senators.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Voting Reform</h2><br/>
<br/>
Considering how much we all hate Congress right now, why don't we consider an alternative for our legislative needs?  Instead of our Representatives & Senators being the only way for us to create/modify laws, we can take a more direct hand in the process.  Arguments can be made whether we are democracy or republic on paper, and even more can be made whether we are either in reality.  I'm not interested debating any of that here, I'm simply going to propose that we enhance our government by moving to a voluntary proxy system.  It's not particularly different from what we have now: we elect representatives to propose laws and vote on them.  But that's where our involvement currently ends, and we're endlessly frustrated by the amount of politics and pork that go into our laws.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Voluntary Voter Proxy System:</strong><br/>
Congress will still work as normal, with Senators and Representatives voting for their districts in matters of deciding laws, policies, and procedures.  However, individual voters will always have the option to vote on any piece of legislation they choose by voting online (using an appropriately secure system; more on that later).  If a voter chooses not to vote or is otherwise unable to vote (in either case the vote automatically gets recorded as "abstain"), then their congressperson's vote will be recorded as a proxy for that voter's abstention.  When it comes time to tally the votes, that legislative district's votes are all counted and the simple majority is assigned as that district's vote (currently the congressperson's vote is the sole deciding factor in determining their legislative district's vote; he/she is an involuntary proxy).<br/>
<br/>
This has a number of benefits.  First, voters who wish to take a more direct hand in voting are able to do so.  Voters who do not wish to do so have their congresspeople manage their government for them.  Citizens who are subject matter experts of particular matters under discussion can make sure their vote is heard, while citizens who know they don't know the first thing about the subject can let their congressperson deal with the problem for them.  Second, by keeping legislative districts intact as-is we retain the existing protections against the rule of the majority.  Third, there is virtually no change to the current process of making law.  The same discussions and scheduling happen as they do now, but the only difference is that the voting deadline is published on the online voting site for the public to take part in.  Fourth, voting in this manner can be submitted ahead of time, allowing for a better understanding of the likelihood of a vote before the deadline.<br/>
<br/>
There are some significant drawbacks however.  First and foremost, none of this can be implemented until we have a robust and secure online voting system.  This is much harder than it appears.  There is a growing body of evidence that online voting cannot maintain vote secrecy without compromising vote validity.  In other words, we would be sacrificing privacy for convenience.  If we wished to preserve voting secrecy for this type of reform, I suppose we could set up permanent voting booths with permanently-manned officials who can manage the task of separating the vote from the voter (by printing off single-issue ballots and managing them like existing ballots), but this will require a tax increase to implement.  As this reform is not a fundamental feature of our government I don't recommend this privacy option - if you want to directly vote on legislation you put your name on your vote.<br/>
<br/>
A second and equal problem is the rule of the uninformed.  Our founding fathers believed in the Theory of Idiocracy; they believed that a government ruled by *informed representatives* was the only way to govern by the will of the people effectively.  The very much believed that voters were (are) uninformed and prone to change their minds on a whim.  By implementing a voluntary proxy system, an argument can be made that we are handing over government to the least informed people at the worst possible times (when issues are important).  We as a nation should consider any voting reform carefully.  After all, some of us voters did vote for Trump and Clinton in the primary season... but I personally believe this change will be beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
I should note a few things for clarity:<br/>
<br/>
1) Voting for congressmen, presidents, judges, and referendums will remain unchanged, with the possible exception of term limits for Congress.  The schedule & timing of voting in our government seems to work pretty well for now, and we have bigger fish to fry.  While gerrymandering is an issue, there aren't any really good solutions to the problem short of increasingly major restructuring of who and what exactly our congresspeople represent (we theoretically could change our legislative district from a geographical areas to political parties, age groups, random placement, or even favorite numbers).  I would also consider requiring these elections to still be done at official voting booths (in other words I wouldn't want online voting for this, at least yet).  There are still times when voter secrecy trumps convenience.<br/>
<br/>
2) These changes would not apply to the Executive or Judicial Branches of government.  The President is the head of the executive office, and is in charge of keeping the government running on a day-to-day basis.  We as a people should not be able to get in his/her way (in terms of backseat driving), and there are good reasons for a single person with security clearance to make critical and time-sensitive decisions for us.  Similarly, the Judicial Branch is (arguably, of course) made up of experts who are infinitely better than us lowly citizens at interpreting law.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Online Voting</strong><br/>
Online voting at the federal level can only be effective with a federal ID, aka a national ID card.  Like the online voting system, there are significant security concerns with a national ID (big data tracking, govt tracking, and ID forging).  But a key fact to remember here is that like it or not all 3 of those problems are already happening whether or not we implement a national ID.  At least with an NID we can start getting some benefits out of the tracking.  We can consolidate a large number of government and private sector tracking identifiers (voter IDs, driver's licenses, social security numbers, credit reports, and optionally fecesbook, email, hospital/doctor account numbers, phone numbers, and bank accounts).  At least half of these are already tracked by your social security number, which is supposed to be a private number known only between you and the SSA.  The only place where an NID can be created is at a voter registration booth or an immigration office (depending on whether or not you are a citizen).  At that time you would set your private NID password that is only usable for the online voting system.  Citizens would have the ability to view pending legislation, current tallies (prior to the voting deadline), and vote on any pending legislation if they wish, while immigrants would only be able to view the proposed legislation and see the current vote tallies.<br/>
<br/>
The early votes are submitted online would still be changeable until the deadline, to accommodate those all-too-frequent instances where you might support a bill up until some politician adds some unrelated pork or waters down the bill to worthlessness.  Voters could then go in and change their votes as long as it is not past the tally deadline.  This can be even more beneficial to us by allowing us to track bill revisions and support history.<br/>
<br/>
Please note I'm promoting a single ID/username for public use, *not* a single username+password for public use.  I would still recommend having different passwords to access each of those services for data security purposes.  Not the DMV, not the SSA, not Fecesbook.  They can still create their own private IDs to track you within their systems, and you would have the option of tying their account to your NID to make your life easier, but you would still log in to Fecesbook with your Fecesbook password, which would not work on the online voting website.<br/>
<br/>
Once a national ID is established and the online voting platform in place, some truly cool opportunities arise.  Foremost among them is the ability to prioritize your concerns.  There's that well-known saying: there are 2 things you never want to get a peek at before you see the finished product:  sausages and legislation.  For meat, this is because blood is gross.  For legislation, this is because of all those back-room deals.  With the power of computers now you can become a professional dealer too (so to speak)!  With a known list of what legislation is still pending, and what everyone's priorities are, we can calculate who should vote for what in order to maximize everyone's priorities.  Similarly, if we use those same priorities and projections, we can audit our congressmen and women to get a true understanding of how much they're representing us vs. the interests of corporations.  Extending the concept further, we could move beyond proposed legislation and into general policy / future planning.  For example, the 2018 income projections and cost projections can be posted online.  On the assumption that income will be less than costs, voters could put their non-binding votes in place for how congress should approach the budget.  Similarly, given our upcoming budget crisis between 2024 and 2032 (due to medicare and retiring baby boomers, not to mention military), a similar non-binding poll could be set up for each of us to provide input for (example 20% to military, 4% to NASA, 25% to the deficit, 43% to healthcare, 7% other, etc).<br/>

<h2>Fix Campaign Finance</h2><br/>
<br/>
For those who had better things to do at the time, the US Supreme Court case <em>United vs. FEC</em> was a landmark case in 2010 that overruled numerous prior decisions and allowed corporations and unions unlimited spending within the realm of campaign finance (aka elections).  The court majority ruled that the First Amendment protects <em>what</em> can be written (anything) and does not protect <em>who</em> can write.  In other words, the First Amendment's "freedom of the press" did not just apply to the media; it instead should be interpreted as freedom for anyone <em>or anything</em> to publish <em>anything</em>.  Therefore, because money is required to publish, corporations and labor unions should be able to directly finance political organizations, which in effect allow corporations to indirectly influence candidates.<br/>
<br/>
As you might expect, the results of this decision have opened the floodgates on spending.  Campaign spending has more than doubled, and all of that growth can be attributed to corporations (aka special interests).  Despite the court's attempt to enable the people as a group to be able to be heard, the people have less of a voice now (it's being drowned out by special interests and the super-rich).  We are being influenced by non-voting entities.  For a dash of common sense, check out the court's dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stevens.  It points out all the problems we're currently having with campaign manipulation, and all the future problems we're likely to have in restricting campaign corruption.<br/>
<br/>
The big problem here is that, as written, the majority's opinion is the correct interpretation of the First Amendment.  Even I have to admit that.  Here is the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  There are no restrictions to speech or written/published works.  None.  Nada.  The framers didn't want to take any chances that a loophole could be found to allow the government to be able to censor it's people.  And it's not like Congress can just fix the problem; this is exactly why this is an Amendment; so Congress can't weasel itself into the works and gum things up.<br/>
<br/>
So what can we do about it?  The only thing I can see is an Amendment to the First Amendment.  Explicitly clarify that the protections provided to the People in the Constitution does not apply to business entities.  Optionally also exclude associations of people (not recommended).  I would say that the freedoms granted do not apply to legal entities that have "perpetual life, the ability to amass large sums of money, limited liability, no ability to vote, no morality, and no purpose outside profit-making" (to use the words of Justice Stevens).  It's not going to be that simple, of course.  Lots of legalese will (and should) go into any proposed Amendment.  But if we can make this happen then we can reinstate a bunch of laws put in place that have historically protected us from corruption and undue influence.<br/>

<h2>Mail Reform</h2><br/>
<br/>
As a nation, we need to discuss the future of our postal service.  At the beginning of our nation, it was nationalized because there were no standardized, effective parcel distribution systems in our national infrastructure.  Today we have UPS, FedEx, DHS, and a number of other smaller organizations that compete with the U.S. Postal Service.  There is no longer a clear need for a nationalized system.  We should consider phasing it out in a decade or so.<br/>
<br/>
If we decide to keep it around, we have a number of problems to contend with.  Most of them stem from the lack of funding for the service.  Before the advent of UPS, FedEx, and even the Pony Express, the Postal Service could rely on funding via stamps and pay-by-weight processes, with the occasional increase in the cost of stamps.  However, the competing services are draining the Postal Service's customer base.  And let's not forget the elephant in the room: the internet has brought email and digital photos to our phones and homes.  We no longer send photos or letters to loved ones.  About the only things we receive by post any more are bills and ads (and most companies are pushing us to move to electronic billing).  I'm not looking forward to having the sole customer of the postal service be snail-mail-spammers.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, a shrinking customer base is no problem for a corporation; you aren't providing services to as many people so you aren't spending money on them any more.  Companies can even lay off a bunch of employees to reduce costs.  Unfortunately, neither of these solutions apply to the Postal Service.  It doesn't matter that nobody is sending mail any more - it still needs to go out and check everyone's mailboxes every day, just in case a citizen somewhere has decided to go old-school and paper mail a postcard.  That's something on the order of 118 million stops every day.<br/>
<br/>
I propose disbanding the Postal Service within the decade.  If I'm overruled, I propose we change the Postal Service to only deliver mail, not pick it up.  If we want to send mail, we can go down to a Post Office.  I'd even get rid of postboxes (other than the ones on Post Office property for those times when the Office is closed).  I believe this would cut much of the cost of the Postal Service.  If I'm still overruled, I'd propose to move funding the Postal Service into the direct control of the Service itself.  Currently the PS can only get stamp price increases by petitioning Congress, and per the 2006 Congress it's not allowed to go into debt greater than 15 billion (which it hit within 10 years due to another arcane edict by that same Congress to pre-fund retirement & healthcare benefits).  Remember the Postal Service consumes no tax dollars by Congressional Decree.  It can only get revenue from stamps and pay-by-weight.  We should allow them to control that price source, especially when we are controlled by another do-nothing Congress.<br/>

<h2>Copyright Reform</h2><br/>
<br/>
Copyright laws protect the rights of "authors of works" to distribute and authorize the use of those works.  While originally intended for books, it has been expanded to include maps, paintings, performances, and even computer programs.  It has been perverted to uselessness.<br/>
<br/>
I hate copyright laws.  They don't protect authors; only their production companies.  It's common knowledge that musicians and authors only receive single-digit percentages of the sales of their works.  And with the internet, it's not like it's hard to distribute your works any more.  Just get a youtube account and you're published :)<br/>
<br/>
Worse than the musician copyright situation is the software situation (Intellectual Property).  Software runs your phone, your computer, your security cameras, and even your TV.  That code is locked away in corporate safes and protected by copyright laws.  This is bad for 2 reasons; first and most importantly there is no way, as a consumer, to verify that the code is functioning and safe.  Secondly, that code is probably inefficient and insecure.<br/>
<br/>
Code that isn't safe is a big problem, and getting bigger.  In the past, bad software could only erase your hard drive or steal your information.  Soon, bad code running the "auto-drive" in your car could kill you, or bad code in your refrigerator could cause it to not cool your food appropriately and spoil your food.  I'm not exaggerating; this will happen.  The problem is even worse when we consider evil hackers.  If we enter into another cold war with Russia or China it's a very real possibility that, because of the insecure code in all our devices, their hackers will try to infect our internet-connected devices with intentionally bad code to try to kill us.  The US has already done something similar to Iran by hacking into their nuclear/plutonium production facilities and subtly unbalancing their centrifuges, significantly slowing down their nuclear program.  It's only a small step to actively sabotaging a target's population.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these growing problems, we have a desperate need to audit our code and ensure it is functioning safely and securely.  Unfortunately we can't do so right now because corporations will not allow anyone access to the code (tech note: I'm talking about closed-source software here).  As a nation we need to be able to get access to the source code of all our software, and be allowed to copy it in order to make sure it functions correctly and securely.<br/>
<br/>
In short, copyright should not extend to software, and furthermore all purchased/leased software should be required to contain the source code that it is based on.  I would go even further and disband Copyright laws entirely.  Authors/artists/musicians would distribute their works freely without monetization; true artists do it for the art after all.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, wiping out copyright entirely would help alleviate some of the worst problems with our healthcare system.  More on that in the healthcare section.<br/>

<div class="section" id="Healthcare">
<a name="healthcare"></a>
<br/>
<h2>Healthcare</h2><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Obamacare</strong><br/>
Let's get this one out of the way early:  I disagree with nearly everything about Obamacare.  While it had good intentions (enforcing access to health insurance for the poor), it is in fact impossible to implement successfully.  The private health insurance providers are bailing out of the healthcare/moneysink marketplace because it's too expensive to insure the people enrolled in those plans.  In other words, the plans aren't profitable and they can't raise the insurance rates for those enrollees/victims (they're too poor to afford higher rates).  Even with the tax penalties supporting the marketplace it can't stay afloat.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, as a Libertarian I find the government legally requiring health insurance to be repulsive and illegal.  Other than Medicaid and Social Security (neither of which are currently solvent), I am not aware of any other aspect of life where the government thinks it can force 100% of its citizens take part in.  There are plenty of things that 100% of the citizens <em>cannot</em> do (murder, stealing, etc), but nothing that 100% <em>must</em> do.  Technically driving is a privilege and requires skill, so it is reasonable to require licensing and because of the dangers involved I live with the justification that vehicle insurance should be mandatory.  But not healthcare.  As a citizen of the United States of America I should not be forced to pay a penalty of I do not drink the government-sponsored kool-aid.  I would do my best to repeal Obamacare along with the associated tax penalty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Replacement - Nationalized Healthcare?</strong><br/>
OK, so I hate Obamacare, so what?  What would I do instead?  Well, I wouldn't nationalize the healthcare system (aka Universal Healthcare).  We already have a prototype of a national healthcare system - it's called Medicare.  Not only is it underfunded for the expected retirement of the Baby Boomers, it is underfunded <strong>now</strong>.  Ask current enrollees how often they are told that their doctor/therapist/pharmacist will no longer provide services to them because the providers refuse to work Medicare.  Medicare regulates all aspects of the cost of services it will pay out for, and it's supposed to follow the market rate but it can't keep up with the cost increases as negotiated between the private insurance providers and the health service providers.  So Medicare (the public insurance provider) consistently underpays the service providers and they're mad as hell; they're not going to take it any more.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Replacement - Privatized Insurance?</strong><br/>
So should we just go back to fully-privatized insurance?  Not likely, it got us into this mess in the first place.  In the current system (and pre-Obamacare), bi-annually or so healthcare service providers (HSP) must negotiate with each and every health insurance provider (HIP) to determine what rates the HIP is willing to pay out for every possible service/product.  If an agreement can be reached then the HSP will provide services to patients/customers who are part of the HIP's plans (it's actually much more complicated than that because it has to be done for each plan; there are multiple industries involved).  The patient/customer is never involved, and has no say in the negotiation process.  At the time of the service, no one has any idea what it will cost for the service, because it depends on what plan from what insurance company the patient is on, whether the service provider is providing services for that plan at that moment, and what the contracted rate is (which of course is not available even with the amazing computers we have right now).  <br/>
<br/>
The medical device industry is just as much to blame.  I'm sure I don't need to mention EpiPen, but even the basic tech is overpriced.  MRI machines have been around and in common use for 20 years now, but I doubt they've decreased much in price.  X-ray machines too, and they're over 100 years old.  In fact, I'd be surprised if the industry has <em>ever</em> experienced a market dip since private health insurance became expected.  A vicious cycle has been created where the medical hardware and production industry knows it can set require nearly any price increase because it knows that the costs to the healthcare service provider will eventually be passed up to the health insurance provider, which will in turn eventually be passed to the patient through the healthcare premiums.  And because there is no market mechanism for the patient to reject the (unknown) price for the product, the patient has to accept the product and we all have to live with the increased premiums.  Privatized insurance only works when there are other market forces in place to provide a check to price gouging by the insurance providers.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Replacement - No Insurance?</strong><br/>
OK, so let's think outside the box for a moment.  What about eliminating health insurance & price regulation altogether?  This will allow traditional capitalist market forces to dictate the cost of services, but leaves us with the traditional problems of the poor people not getting the same services as the rich.  But I don't think the problem would be nearly as bad as we all imagine because the cost of most services would reset back down to rational levels.  That broken bone will no longer cost $55,000; a trip to the emergency room, x-ray, surgery & cast could reasonably cost less than $1000.  Considering that most Obamacare Bronze HMO plans (the cheapest) cost $8,000 before you even get the benefits the insurance ($164/monthly payments, $6,850 deductable, and eventually a $6,850 out of pocket maximum on top of all that), I'm pretty sure even the poorest can afford healthcare without insurance getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Opponents of this solution always argue that, unlike all other capitalist markets, healthcare services are a non-optional service.  Opponents often take this to the extreme with life-threatening scenarios like cancer.  I strongly disagree with this claim.  There are certainly some procedures that are more necessary than others, but absolutely none are required because the patient can always opt to forgo the service.  I steadfastly believe that this applies most strongly to the life threatening scenarios.  These scenarios can easily top $150,000 in today's marketplace, but whatever the cost I'd personally prefer to forgo the service and put that money into something myself or my heirs could get some use out of.  Maybe take that vacation I'd been planning on doing someday, or fund the grandchildrens' education.  On a side note, I also fully support medically-assisted suicide for death-with-dignity.  My point is that while you can't buy happiness, you can't really buy life either and the sooner we as a society learn to accept death as a natural part of life the faster we can start fixing the healthcare system.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Final Verdict</strong><br/>
As much as I hate to say it, I think the only viable solution for healthcare is eliminating health insurance and price regulation.  This, of course, requires active patient participation in price negotiation, but this is a problem that was solved long before health insurance existed; in some cases the patient has the upper hand (when emergency services have been applied, and the patient can always walk away and make the provider eat the cost if the provider can't provide a reasonable price point).  In other cases the provider has the upper hand (when proactive or other known upcoming services will need to be performed), but even then the provider still can't gouge the patient because the patient can always find a competitor.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I fully realize that my opinion is in the vast minority.  I have no illusions that the people of this country would support this solution, so this is not a major platform for me; I'm just providing my opinion on the matter and will let Congress do whatever dumb thing it will do.  I'd support repealing Obamacare, but I'd also support leaving it as-is since nobody's going to do it right.<br/>

<div class="section" id="Economy">
<a name="economy"></a>
<br/>
<h2>Economic matters</h2><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Immigration</strong><br/>
Our country was built upon immigration and expansion.  There's no good reason for not accepting those who wish to partake in our good fortune and awesome culture.  Especially if they had the courage and willpower to leave their lives behind and risk their family for a chance at a better life.  I'd immediately pardon any Mexican immigrant and grant amnesty along with citizenship to all.  That goes for pretty much anyone in our borders right now.  I'd take it a step further and expand our immigration policies to allow more people to come in legally.<br/>
<br/>
I'd push for 2 paths for entry: 1) Continue the existing immigration process as-is, with the horrendous wait times and maze of forms.  2) If the immigrant does not want to wait for this process, they can elect for a more streamlined process that would be, to put it bluntly, invasive, embarrassing, and controlled throughout by the government.  Process 2 basically involves a strip search of the immigrant and all items being brought into the nation.  Once "cleared through security", the immigrant will be placed somewhere within the US at the discretion of the government with little to no input of the immigrant.  A likely place might be Detroit, where there are whole sections of the city sitting empty, waiting for people to move in.  An alternative might be spread throughout the breadbasket of the nation, where low-cost & unpretentious labor is needed.  A third option might be to simply build a city for the immigrants somewhere where the economy needs a boost.  Building a city from scratch is no joke, and it's ridiculously expensive, but it is also a great booster to the economy.  I think the idea merits exploring, if nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
I think our best bet for immigration, however, is to consider peacefully expanding our borders.  I'd argue that any nation-state that wishes to petition the Union for admission must be either bordering US territory or have a coastline that is incapable of being 100% blockaded by a superpower.  I'd fully support expanding into each of the continents on Earth.  Cuba, Mexico, Japan, South Korea; anywhere we are accepted (accepted in truth, not just in name) that cannot be torn from our grasp and our support.  We did it for Texas and Hawaii, we can do it for Mexico and South Korea.  This plan, of course, is not without its risks or surprises.  We'd need to keep our military at our current spending levels (and actually use it to defend our new borders), and the terrorist threat map would be completely redrawn (which is more good than bad).  Anyway, this is extremely long-term planning here, and would never come to fruition in this term.  But hey, innovative solutions to complex problems, right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Government spending (immediate needs)</strong><br/>
Our biggest costs over the next 20 years are 1) National debt/interest, 2) Military, and 3) Medicare/Social Security.  All need to be reigned in immediately before we break the world economy (again).  National debt cannot be tackled until we stem the flow of spending.<br/>
<br/>
I've always been a fan of a compromise solution - reduce spending in both.  For every dollar stripped from the military budget we'd drop medicaid spending by an equal amount.  I always thought that would please both parties.  Unfortunately, the imminent retirement of the Baby Boomers and their shift from workers (cost sharers) to Medicaid recipients (cost makers) makes that plan impossible.  There are no easy answers with this problem.  We either raise payroll taxes to make up the deficit or we divert monies from other programs.  I propose that we permanently decrease the military budget by half (phased in over a number of years).  This chunk of regular income will be permanently designated for emergency funds to be used for the crisis of the day.  Initially it will be used for the duration of the Baby Boomer crisis (as defined by Congress <em>immediately</em> with a hard deadline, say 20 years), we should put that money into Medicaid and Social Security.  As that generation dies out that money can then be routed into the national debt.  By the time we wrap up those 2 crises (24 years from now) I'm sure we'll have 2 more.  Our country has never been run with a surplus of forethought, after all.<br/>
<br>
While I'm sure the Democrats would love this plan as-is, we can all hear the screaming and wailing from the Republicans.  In return for the "short term" emergency fund injection into our failing social services, I would push for a planned closure of both Medicare and Social Security after the pre-defined crisis timeline is over.  I would then roll half of the revenue currently allocated toward Medicare + Social Security into other nationalized systems like education, transportation infrastructure, NASA, and other government-run industries.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, with this solution everyone gets the important half of what they wanted in the first place and the only people that get burned is a generation that never really expected to have a solvent Social Security Fund in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Government spending (long-term policies)</strong><br/>
As a Libertarian, I generally hold to smaller government, deregulation and laissez faire economics (let the markets bubble and deflate on their own without oversight).  Specifically, I don't believe in too-big-to-fail.  I'd have let the auto industries collapse and restructure, and if necessary fold.  Same with the banks and real estate industries.  All of the Great Recession could have been handled without government intervention and the ensuing panic.  The only intelligent thing done during the Great Recession was to authorize the FDIC to increase the deposit insurance to $250,000 per account.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the government I consider to be ripe for pruning and/or dismantling.  Military, social services, etc.  That said, there are certain industries and places where the government is best suited to be the oversight agency, which I'd leave mostly untouched.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>EPA</strong><br/>
Citizens are bad at managing the environment, because it's such a long-term process so far beyond the human lifespan.  Companies will not manage the environment at all.  Sadly, as poor of a solution it is, the EPA appears to be the best agency to protect us from ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>FTC</strong><br/>
The Federal Trade Commission acts as a check against the largest corporations, and specifically implements antitrust measures.  It has many other duties but I won't bore you with them.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>FCC</strong><br/>
The Federal Communication Commission acts as a standards creation and enforcement agency which maintains authority over various things like what frequency cell phones, televisions, and microwaves operate on, all so that they don't overlap.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>IANA</strong><br/>
The International Assigned Numbers Authority is the agency in charge of determining what computer programs use which communication protocol numbers.  This is normally something that would be under the FCC's area of expertise, but the internet is an international problem which requires management by an international agency.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Automation Crisis</strong><br/>
At long last, science fiction is turning into science.  Within 20 years, computers will be powerful enough to take over many basic tasks currently handled by low-skill labor, and even many advanced white-collar jobs.  Basically almost anything that can be considered repetitive has the possibility to be automated by advanced computer processing.  A few common examples of jobs that are ripe for replacement by our future electronic overlords are taxi/truck/bus/train drivers, radiologists, and even lawyers.  About the only jobs that are expected to be safe are jobs that require physically moving around (while computing power is an imminent problem, robotics hasn't caught up yet) and jobs that require dynamic or on-the-fly thinking.  The biggest limitation to automation is expected to be the relative lack of programmers.  So while many people will be unemployed because of the automation crisis, the IT industry will be constantly growing.<br/>
<br/>
The scope of the upcoming crisis is much like the economic upheaval we saw 100 years ago with the invention of the assembly line - the country saw massive shifts in the skill set of the workforce back then too.  The main difference is that while the assembly line's changes brought about a need for unskilled labor capable of handling long hours and repetitive tasks, the automation crisis' changes will require a shift back to specialized labor (IT) and highly dynamic tasks.  Another difference is that while the assembly line forced the population to move from rural areas to cities, the Automation Crisis has the chance to move us back into rural areas because much of IT can be done remotely from home (provided there is a home office that is free of distractions and the employee is sufficiently tempered to actually do work from home).<br/>
<br/>
As a nation we can handle this problem by immediately integrating mandatory programming lessons into school programs.  A properly prepared generation of workforce will all need to be able to program in numerous languages as well as be able to convert business needs into programming logic (the difference between these two tasks is the same as the difference between being able to do math and being able to do word problems).  I'd immediately authorize an expansion to our public education system to include college-level studies.  In effect, a college degree or equivalent business training will be required for the next generation of students to survive in our automated economy.  This solves the long-term workforce, but the short-term workforce is just as vulnerable.  I'd also supplement the aforementioned expansions with a free national skill set retraining program to assist the current workforce in transition from whatever menial job they're doing into a programmer or other IT worker bee.  However, I must stress that in order for this solution to be effective, this skill set retraining program must be put in place as soon as possible, and more importantly, the people must voluntarily start transitioning before the Automation Problem turns into a full-fledged Automation Crisis.  And it goes without saying that the workforce must do its utmost to actually learn the skills.  There are no slackers in programming:)<br/>
<br/>
So after spending 2 pages harping like a Libertarian about reducing government spending and dismantling Social Security, I've just expanded another social program and added another.  How do I plan to pay for it?  Well, in short, we'll have to raise taxes to support the new programs, but I do not believe the cost of this expansion needs to be as drastic as you are imagining.  Remember, thanks to computers, we can do online classes for teaching programming, and remote lectures.  In fact, many of the skill set transitions can be considered night classes attended from home.  Hopefully, many of the processes we put in place can be integrated into the existing public schools system.  It will be interesting to consider a school system that is entirely remote, where the parents are on-hand to help the children with problems when necessary.  It will be even more interesting to consider the social effects of such a change in both the economic and school environments. Would our friends be remote too?<br/>
<br/>
There is one theoretical alternative to funding public education - we could shift our economy to a Universal Basic Income, where the government simply pays citizens to breath.  I hope that even if you suck at math you can see that this type of economy is way more expensive than anything we are doing right now (assuming we pay each citizen enough to pass the poverty line), and that the math cannot add up.  The remaining people who would still choose to do work would essentially have a 100% tax rate.  In short, Universal Basic Income cannot solve an economy where the majority of the workforce is unemployable.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I hope we could all agree that whatever the cost of publicly funding college-level subjects, it will inevitably be cheaper than a total collapse of a capitalistic economy...which is the situation if we do nothing and let 50% of our workforce get laid off and not provide said retraining.<br/>

<h2>National Security</h2><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dismantle the Department of Homeland Security</strong><br/>
First off, I'd take the relatively easy step of completely dismantling the DHS and Transportation Security Agency (TSA).  Their efforts would be laughable if they didn't inconvenience us on a daily basis.  In the 15 years they have been in existence I can only think of a single incident where DHS or any other federal agency effectvely utilized their expanded powers to stop a terrorist attack.  The full body scanners at airports are invasive and ineffective.  The entire 9/11 security policy structure is so worthless it is collectively known as "security theater" by experts.  I'd flush it all away and return us back to pre-9/11 policies and procedures, with the added caveat that the public will know that their services might be required in terrorist scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Intelligence gathering</strong><br/>
Let's be real for a second:  no matter how much we yell and scream at the NSA and the CIA about invasions of foreign power computers, or even our own computers, they are going to hack away at anyone and everyone to spy on everyone.  It's a necessary part of protecting our nation.  I, as president, would authorize security agencies to legitimately hack into devices at will.  Let me be <em>very</em> clear on my terminology here: I'd allow them to <em>hack</em> into devices and servers, where "hacking" is the act of breaking into a supposedly secure system.  Hacking does not mean backdoors into systems, it does not mean universal access keys, and it does not mean forceful search or seizure of systems.  That said, I am a strong proponent of data security and full encryption.  Everyone should be communicating over encrypted protocols by default, and client software (on the phones/computers/etc) should be encrypting data with private keys managed by end users *before* the data is transmitted to servers for backup and remote access.  The NSA is allowed to attempt to hack through that encryption as long as they don't impact the targets in the process.<br/>
<br/>
I would <strong>not</strong> allow these agencies to just waive a piece of paper that legally forces companies to drop trow and bend over unless it is a matter of utmost security.  I'd disband warrantless National Security Letters and nondisclosure as they exist now.  Warrantless NSLs and temporary nondisclosures would still be able to be presented to companies in extreme situations, but in all cases such actions MUST be made public within 30 days and ALL relevant data (as determined by the public) must be made available along with that notice.  This still allows covert national security procedures for the most critical of situations while making it so expensive to utilize that it will be a rare event.  Remember, the 30 day mandatory release can always be done by the recipient of the letter, and when I say "determined by the public" I mean without limitation.  If an NSL is presented to Yahoo for access to email account XXX the public can legitimately request information about what the director of the CIA had for lunch on that day (and expect an immediate, full, truthful response).<br/>
<br/>
On a more general note, my policies in general (which include our internal police forces all the way down to private security) with regards to spying or searching can be considered to be "non-impact-allowed".  I'm fine with license plate readers, cameras on traffic lights, and/or 100% recorded phone conversations with regards to information gathering, as long as we as a society are willing for fork out the cash.  I'm not fine with fingerprint scanners, iris scanners, or police stops.  If you are not impacted by spying at the time you are doing whatever it is you are doing, then the government should be allowed to do the spying.  Conversely, if you are delayed or denied in any way doing whatever it is you are doing, then the government was wrong to spy on you.  In other words, I'm prioritizing your liberties over the government's idea of security.<br/>

<strong>Reduce military spending</strong><br/>
A national military is necessary and justified.  But does it need to be as big as it is?  Back in our grandparent's generation we certainly needed a big army to counter-act Hitler and Stalin.  Their war was one of power and brutality.  Our parents lived through the Cold War.  Theirs was a war of subtlety and pawns.  Our generation has a war on "terror".  Sigh.  In effect, we are fighting against lone wolf extremists of two types: internal religious extremists manipulated through foreign religious extremists and "regular" citizens who've simply given into despair and decided to take out as many people as possible on their way to hell.  Neither of these threats are external forces, and as such our military is largely sitting around with nothing to do, and it's spending more than the next-largest 8 countries <em>combined</em>.  Something's got to be done; I'd cut military spending in half (that's still more than China and Russia combined).  I don't have any details on what gets cut and what doesn't, I'd have to discuss with professionals on that matter who have access to top secret clearances and whatnot.  All I can say for now is that it's necessary for economic reasons (see my section "<span class="hyperlink" onclick="sectionClicked('Economy')">Economy</span>"). Pretty much all the experts agree that our military is so much more powerful than the rest of the world's that we can stand to reduce our standing strength.<br/>
<br/>
I'd work to restructure our military forces into more flexible and mobile strike forces, as opposed to our current monolithic stumbling structure.  I mean, there has to be cost savings when the nuclear codes are still stored on 8-inch floppy disks - those haven't been in use in the private sector since <em>The Little Mermaid</em> was released in 1989.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I would keep our existing nuclear weapons (because it's just as dangerous in the missile as in a storage bunker), but put a stop to future weapons-grade plutonium production.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I'd consider making a 6th branch of the armed forces dedicated to information warfare (aka hacking), or otherwise expanding the IT infrastructure within the existing military framework.  Granted the CIA and NSA already have a bunch of uber cool hackers, but they have higher priorities than making sure that our aircraft carriers get all their onboard computers upgraded from Windows XP.<br/>

<strong>Expand the Union</strong><br/>
Adding nation-states into the union provides a stronger and more flexible tax base, while increasing diversity within the borders of the US and promoting a new Pax Americana.  See the section "<span class="hyperlink" onclick="sectionClicked('Economy')">Economy</span>" for more details.<br/>

<h2>International Affairs</h2><br/>
<br/>
<strong>ISIS:</strong><br/>
Since we need to reduce military spending, I'd most likely have to pull out of the battle against ISIS, at least unless the UN wants to fund us.  It's not like anyone wants us butting in there.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Iran:</strong><br/>
This is probably the hardest problem we face.  The existing government is actively set against us and our allies, and the citizens won't support a coup or other "night strike".  We can only deal above the table here, and we have nothing Iran wants.  At least, not since we loosened our embargo.  I hope and pray they're keeping their side of that bargain.  But it's done, no turning back the page there.  We just have to hope Iran doesn't decide to do anything evil to Israel with their nukes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Israel vs. Palestine, Round 17!</strong><br/>
OK, this is harder than Iran, but only because it's impossible to solve.  Both Israel and Hamas (the terrorist element in the Palestinian-controlled areas) feel entitled to the land and feel the other is intruding.  Neither are particularly open to negotiation with the other.  One side supports rebel extremists who throw rockets over the wall and the other side is happy to retaliate with exponential force. It simply will not stop until one side or another is wiped off the face of the earth.  We will truly be forced to let them kill each other and let God sort it out. Any support of Israel will kill any goodwill in negotiating with any other Arab nation.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>North Korea:</strong><br/>
This is one of the few times I'd advocate direct and open military intervention.  We have a nuclear-powered madman controlling a nation-cult who's actively trying to build nuclear ICBMs to use against us.  I can't imagine that it would be too hard to insert a team of Green Berets to take out the ruling leaders and let South Korea absorb the North.  Heck, I'd even support China taking them over.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Crimea/Russia:</strong><br/>
This is another time when I'd openly use the military (with the support of Ukraine proper) to forcefully take back the Crimean Peninsula.  Any justification the Crimeans (aka the Russians) had to independence was lost when Russian missiles were used to shoot down MH17.  Russia blames that on the strike on the Ukrainian government but do not show any evidence, while our evidence is universally verified by international exerts and 3rd parties to be as close to proof as we're ever going to get.  Russia will back down if we go in with the support of the rest of the world on this.  We're already in a second Cold War with Russia, we might as well start playing the game before Russia takes something we care about...<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cuba:</strong><br/>
I'd admit them into the Union.  Fastest way to fix that problem.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brexit:</strong><br/>
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!  Giggle.  Snort.<br/>

<h2>Journal of Scientific Experimental Reproducibility</h2><br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest invisible problems we have right now is the lack of reproducibility in scientific experiments.  Science, as a process, is supposed to be very pessimistic.  Scientists reading the details of a theory and experiment by another scientist are supposed to assume that the scientist who is presenting his findings is a blowhard who doesn't know what he or she is talking about.  In other words, the presenting scientist is supposed to prove his or her case as completely and thoroughly as possible.  If successful, the reader can believe that the presenter <em>might</em> be correct.  Further experiments, hopefully done by completely different scientists, should be done to confirm that the original presenter was correct (or instead highlight if the author was simply really sneaky or lucky).  If the second set of experiments has been done and verified by that third scientist, then the theory presented by that original scientist carries more weight.  But if a fourth scientist comes up with a different theory that can explain the results from those two experiments just as well, then even <em>more</em> experiments will be necessary.  Eventually the repetition and variations of all these experiments might show which theory is more likely to be true.  This whole process is loosely called "Reproducibility", and it is in danger from extinction.  This is due to the way our scientific research economy works; scientists only get funded if they can convince an organization to donate or otherwise fund their research.  <br/>
<br/>
Some scientists become direct employees of companies in their R&D departments.  These researchers usually end up doing research at the direction of their employer.  Oftentimes if the research does not result in a conclusion the employer likes, the experiment is buried and no one ever knows it was done.  If the conclusion is the result the employer desires, then it might be published.  In those cases, other scientists should take extra care in vetting the presented experiments because as we all know there are lies, damn lies, and statistics, and the employer will sometimes put pressure on the researcher to spin the numbers in their favor to make themselves look more successful.<br/>
<br/>
Some scientists work for universities, and part of their tenure contract usually allocates a certain amount of paid time, manpower (grad students) and money towards research of the scientist's (now professor's) choice.  Unfortunately, the main factor to provide (and maintain) tenure to a potential professor is generally made by determining the scientist's worth as a researcher (in other words, how often they get papers published in journals and how successful their theories are).  This often puts pressure on the scientist to spin the numbers to make their results more significant than they otherwise might be, or to hide known holes in their experimental process.<br/>
<br/>
Some scientists fund their research through grants (provided by trusts, foundations, or government agencies).  In truth, this method of funding is more of a supplemental method used by the two listed above (it's often considered mandatory in conjunction with the other two).  While in theory these grants are non-judgmental, they are granted under the same merits as tenure: by the potential viability of the scientist and how much potential the experiment has to be interesting.  This further puts pressure on researchers to spin and market their experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Even after funding is raised and the experiment concluded, the final challenge is getting published in a respectable Journal.  Scientists submit their paper to Journals and if the editor cares enough about the paper it will go through a "peer review" (that first phase of the process I mentioned above).  There are many, many more experiments and papers than there are journals.  If the paper passes the peer review, then the editor makes the final choice whether or not to publish the paper, generally basing the decision on the strength of the experiment's results and how interesting the paper might be for the readers.  It's perpetually a buyer's market, and scientists generally beg and plead to get their papers published (ever hear the phrase "publish or perish"?).  All these market forces cause scientists of all backgrounds and industries to over-promote their articles and results.  Similarly, Journal editors have no desire to publish a boring second round of experiments that verify the first paper.  There is no market mechanism for scientific papers and theories to be verified in our modern society.<br/>
<br/>
This lack of Reproducibility is slowly turning the venerable and formerly rock-solid reputation for science into swiss cheese.  Scientist A's paper claims hair loss can be countered by an infusion of antioxidants applied as lip balm and no one can be bothered to refute it.  Unfortunately, when newspaper journalists' internet search through scientific journal papers relating to antioxidants and turn up that paper on how lip balm can prevent hair loss, the journalist is not a scientist and does not know that the paper is junk.  The next thing you know you have Trump citing this fluff news article (incorrectly) and promoting lipstick for preventing male baldness.  This is a funny example, but it gets ugly quickly when, for example, climate scientists (or deniers) start using poorly-backed references.  Or when SpaceX uses some over-pimped paper to design the next generation of rocket O-rings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I propose we set up a government-funded journal, the Journal of Scientific Experimental Reproduction (JoSER), which will be dedicated to publishing those second-stage papers that are attempting to verify whether or not a particular experiment is valid or not.  I would make it an online-only journal to reduce costs and allow an essentially unlimited number of secondary papers to be published each month.  The cost of this new department/journal would be minimal, probably the smallest section of the government.  <br/>
<br/>
I think of it as a necessary audit process for science, kind of like SEC filings.  In effect, the JoSER would be bolstering the Quality Assurance process of science itself.  I have a hard time thinking up better uses of government money.<br/>
